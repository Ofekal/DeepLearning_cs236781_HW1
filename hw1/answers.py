part3_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**


Write your answer using **markdown** and $\LaTeX$:
```python

The exact value of $\Delta > 0$ does not matter because it only affects the magnitude of the weights,
#COMPLETE 


An equation: $e^{i\pi} -1 = 0$



"""

part3_q2 = r"""
**Your answer:**


1. The image visualization of the weights can give us information about them. We can see that each element represent
a different digit. Generally speaking, the weights determines which features has more impact on the label it belongs to.
And viewing the image this can be understood - the weights learns which pixels are more important for each clas.
For instance, we can see that the most left image has a round shape like 0 inside of it, and the one next to it is similar to the digit 1 etc.
Looking at the images, we can understand why the model made errors.
